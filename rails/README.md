In our presentation we missed one single point: 	‚óè Users can edit or delete their own submissions until approved. (2 points).
Here, we have a "My Submissions" tab on the profile section that allows the user to see all "In Progress" products along with the "Accepted Products". While being in progress, there will be 2 options: "Edit" and "Delete".

Right now we are preparing a guide on how to run the application on a local environment. If you need any help, don't hesitate to contact us on Discord.
